## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this application on your local machine, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. You can check if you have Node.js installed by running:

```node -v```

And check if you have npm installed by running:

```npm -v```


If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). npm is distributed with Node.js, which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.

### Installing

After making sure your machine meets the prerequisites, you can proceed with the following steps to get a development env running:

First, clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running:
```git clone https://github.com/rfp-2305-uranus/fec-uranus.git```


Then, navigate to your cloned repository by running:
```cd fec-uranus```

Inside the repository, install the necessary npm packages by running:
```npm install```

Include a `.env` file with the included variables
```
REACT_APP_API_KEY = <your_api_key_>
PORT = 3000
```

### Running the application

After installing the dependencies, you can now run the application in development mode using:
```npm run start```

The application will then be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/`.

When ready for production the app can be built using:
```npm run build```

You can host the app using the included express.js server using:
```npm run server-prod```

The app will be hosted on port `3000`
